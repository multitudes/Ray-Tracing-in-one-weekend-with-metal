# Ray Tracing in one weekend with metal
A spin of the popular book series adapted for the power of Apple Silicon. 
I did a C version here: [Ray-Tracing-in-One-Weekend-in-C](https://github.com/multitudes/Ray-Tracing-in-One-Weekend-in-C) but i am curious to see how to reimplement this with Metal and learn Metal along the way.
